# Cassia Library Framework (CLF)

A sophisticated microservices-based data pipeline framework built on .NET 8 that handles extraction, transformation, and loading of data from various external sources with distributed computing capabilities.

## üöÄ Overview

The Cassia Library Framework (CLF) is a scalable, maintainable data processing platform that follows clean architecture principles and leverages Microsoft Orleans for distributed computing. It provides a robust foundation for ingesting data from multiple external sources, transforming it, and making it available through a unified API.

## ÔøΩ Project Story: Building Technology for Humanitarian Impact

Cassia Map is a humanitarian geospatial platform developed under the Cassia Library initiative, designed to provide real-time disaster awareness and location-based insights for communities across Myanmar. As Lead Developer, the system was built to turn raw event data into clear, accessible, and life-saving information during times of crisis.

The platform streams up-to-date data on natural hazards such as floods, cyclones, earthquakes, and fires‚Äîaggregating from multiple open and trusted sources. Using scalable cloud-native architecture and AI-assisted enrichment, Cassia Map processes and visualizes this information on an interactive map interface that supports time filtering, historical timelines, and geospatial overlays.

One of the platform's core goals is accessibility. Cassia Map is optimized for low-connectivity environments and mobile devices, with a roadmap that includes offline-first PWA support and multilingual AI chat assistance to help users understand risk in real time. The backend combines a geospatial event pipeline with a resilient, maintainable architecture designed to scale as user needs grow.

This project represents the first major layer of the broader Cassia Library ecosystem‚Äîa knowledge and resource platform focused on safety, education, and practical guidance during emergencies. It reflects a commitment to building reliable, human-centered systems that serve those most in need, using technology as a force for preparedness, understanding, and support.
